This mod scales all traits of leaders and civilisations by 10. So every trait is 10 times stronger, bigger, and more powerfull. Guaranteed very balanced.

Because this mod alters almost every trait/unit/building in the game, it is most likely incompatible with most gameplay changing mods, UI mods and such should be fine.

For other 10x mods, check out HaruhiBot's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=937361571]Wondersx10[/url] and HaoJun0823's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=938733933]10xPantheon[/url].

I also made a [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=957164931]x3-version[/url], which scales everything by a factor of 3.
