This mod scales all traits of leaders and civilisations by 10. So every trait is 10 times stronger, bigger, and more powerfull. Guaranteed very balanced.

Because this mod alters almost every trait/unit/building in the game, it is most likely incompatible with most gameplay changing mods, UI mods and such should be fine.

This mod is only in English. Currently working on German localization.

For other 10x mods, check out HaruhiBot's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=937361571]Wondersx10[/url] and HaoJun0823's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=938733933]10xPantheon[/url].

I also made a [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=957164931]x3-version[/url], which scales everything by a factor of 3.

Notes:
The bonuses to combat strenght are scaled in such a way, that the difference to damage dealt is tenfold. A bonus of +5 increases damage dealt by 22%, so with the x10-mod it should increase by 220%. 
A bonus of +5 from a vanilla then increases to +29.

Please tell, if something is wrong or was not implemented correctly.
